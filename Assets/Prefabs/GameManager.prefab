  dialogue:
  - key: explain situation
    dialogue:
    - Well then! That landing was a bit rougher than I had hoped. I will scan the
      ship and our current surroundings. (Click to Continue)
    - Scanning . . .
    - Scan complete.
    - Bad news. The ship has sustained substantial damaged and three core components
      are missing.
    - Good news, the planet is only inhabited by flora. Fauna is not present. You
      are currently the only living animal to set foot on this planet.
  - key: explain building placement
    dialogue:
    - You are going to need to find those pieces off your ship if we are going to
      get home. Let me start the back-up generator.
    - Done. But, it does not look like that will be enough to get us by. You are going
      to need to build your way out of here.
    - You see that shiny lump of minerals over there? It is a common resource in our
      universe, and it is used in most buildings back home.
  - key: build harvester menu icon
    dialogue:
    - To help you in your journey, I am going to download important building blueprints.
    - Downloading . . .
    - Download complete.
    - The blueprints have been implemented. Click on the icon to open the building
      menu.
  - key: build harvester harvester icon
    dialogue:
    - The first blueprint to be used will be the harvester.
    - Use the mouse to select the harvester. Other buildings will become available
      to you once you have enough materials.
  - key: build harvester place harvester
    dialogue:
    - Now, place the harvester on top of the mineral by clicking it.
  - key: build generator
    dialogue:
    - Great! Seems the bump on your head from the landing did not do as much damage
      as I thought.
    - Now that you have some minerals, you can build another power generator.
    - See this gauge? It shows you how much power you currently have.
    - Do not be fooled, though. Each building you place will chew into your power
      reserve.
    - 'Hovering over the harvester will show you its power consumption. '
    - Do not forget this will be the same for every building. Now, build a power generator.
  - key: build relay
    dialogue:
    - Great. The more generators you have, the quicker your power gauge replenishes.
    - 'You can place another building called power relays. These are important. '
    - 'When you place them, they increase your power range from your hub. '
    - Place one now, you will see what I mean.
  - key: fog hazard detect
    dialogue:
    - Perfect! Now you can . . . hold on, my sensors are picking up something.
  - key: fog hazard will kill you
    dialogue:
    - "Oh golly\u2026 you see that nice, thick fog that is currently seeping its way
      towards us? "
    - It is sentient, and not happy that we are here.
    - Oh boy, it wants to nibble your giblets. Well, more accurately, it wants to
      suck the oxygen from your lungs . . .
    - '. . . and replace it with some deadly toxins that have a 98.12% chance of killing
      you instantly, and if you died . . . '
    - '. . . I would be left here all alone, with no one but me, sitting here talking
      to myself . . . '
    - . . . and goodness knows how long . . . sorry, I ramble when I am nervous.
    - "It seems to only want us dead, it hasn\u2019t touched the ship pieces. "
    - For all that you can worship in this universe, find those pieces and get us
      home alive!
  - key: build arc defence
    dialogue:
    - WAIT! Before you go, I have a plan!
    - Have you heard of an arc defence or a repel fan? No? Well, you have now.
    - And luckily for us I was smart enough to download their blueprints along with
      the other buildings.
    - 'Now that you know how to place buildings, try placing an arc defence. '
  - key: build repel fan
    dialogue:
    - See how it pushes the fog away for a moment?
    - That should be enough time to let you decide if that is the way you want to
      venture.
    - Now place a repel fan.
  - key: gloat
    dialogue:
    - It worked? HAH! Take that you degenerate fog! . . . Wait, it cannot hear me
      can it?
